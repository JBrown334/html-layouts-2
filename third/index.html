        <p><h1>Great Scott!</h1> Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. What about George? Huh? Crazy drunk drivers. Yeah.

<p>He's a very strange young man. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Marty, are you alright? </p>

<p>Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Hi. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?</p>

<p>You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. What, I don't get what happened. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Actually, people call me Marty. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?</p>

<p>Where does he come from? Oh, yeah, yeah. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Yeah. What?</p>
