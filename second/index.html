        Just finishing up the second coat now. Huh? Um, well it's a delorean, right? Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

Marty, will we ever see you again? You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Mom, Dad. Take care.
