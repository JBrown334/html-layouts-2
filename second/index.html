        Just finishing up the second coat now. Huh? Um, well it's a delorean, right? Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

Marty, will we ever see you again? You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Mom, Dad. Take care.

          George: you ever think of running for class president? Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Well uh, good, fine. Huh?

I guarantee it. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. No, why, what's a matter? We never would have fallen in love. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.

Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. I think we need a rematch. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? What's the meaning of this.
